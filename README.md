My Screeps

Here's my attempt at coding up a Screeps. It's an es6 project transpiled down with Babel to ensure that it works and as a proof-of-concept for a babel transpile task.

To get started, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run build
nmp run deploy
```

To deploy, there's a config file, `/screeps.js` to fill out that the deploy task creates if it cannot find it. It will hold your login credentials, so don't commit it.
