My Screeps

Here's my attempt at coding up a Screeps. It's an es6 project transpiled down with Babel to ensure that it works and as a proof-of-concept for a babel transpile task.

To get started, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

To deploy, there's a config file to use, but I gitignored mine. (More info to come)
